# How to use the Randomize
- In case you want to implement a random function or give a random number value The Random module contains some very useful functions.

So first of all Make Sure To Import random Before The Code in order to use it

Randint: This will generate a value between 2 numbers given e.g:

	print(random.randint(10,25))

- This will give you a random integer between

- Choice Generate a random value from a sequence e.g:

colors = ['red', 'black', 'green'] random.choice(colors)

- Shuffle shuffles the elements in list in place, so they are in a random order E.g:

	x = [[i] for i in range(10)] random.shuffle(x)

Randrange Generate a randomly selected element from range(start, stop, step) Ex:

for i in range(3): print random.randrange(0, 101, 5)

# Risk Analysis
The probability of any unwanted behaviour is defined as Risk , risk analysis is the process of identifying the risks in applications or software that you built and prioritizing them to test.

- Why to use Risk Analysis?
1. highlights the potential problem areas
2. helps the developers and managers to mitigate the risks

risks that you might encounter:

1. Use of new hardware
2. Use of new technology
3. Use of new automation tool
4. The sequence of code
5. Availability of test resources for the application

- there are certain risks that are unavoidable such as:

The time that you allocated for testing , defect leakage due to the complexity or size of the application , Urgency from the clients to deliver the project
Incomplete requirements

## Risk Identification & Assessmnet

The perspective of Risk Assessment
**Effect:** To assess risk by Effect. In case you identify a condition, event or action and try to determine its impact.

**Cause:** To assess risk by Cause is opposite of by Effect. Initialize scanning the problem and reach to the point that could be the most probable reason behind it.

**Likelihood:** To assess risk by Likelihood is to say that there is a probability that a requirement wonâ€™t be satisfied.
