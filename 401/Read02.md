- TDD : stands for Test Driven Developemnt that considered a strategy or a way of thinking that tests the thing first!

- Unit test: you can conclude from their name as they are units(piece of code) that checks input,output, and the behaviour of your code while you are writinh your code


# Recursion 

- I used to know that recursion is a method of problem solving that breaks the problem into sub-problems in order  to make them simple and easy to solve , but here is another conncept which is the process of calling a function inside another function either if it's direct or indirect.

e.g: Recursive adding 

	f(n) = 1                  n=1

	f(n) = n + f(n-1)    n>1
