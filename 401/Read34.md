## Ethics in the workplace

Never code somthing illegal that would cause problems and harms to others like some cases where some of medical websites leads to alot of young people's death by recommending drugs in order to push it to stores.

your software shouldn't violate and human rights or supports any kind of dicrimancy between people genders , color , and origin or used for any kind of political inequality. In General , while you are coding at your own pace from yor home consider the technical legislation and be aware of DMCA.

## Ethics in Technology

Imagine if

```
It’s a bright, sunny day and you’re alone in your spanking new self-driving vehicle, sprinting along the two-lane Tunnel of Trees on M-119 high above Lake Michigan north of Harbor Springs. You’re sitting back, enjoying the view. You’re looking out through the trees, trying to get a glimpse of the crystal blue water below you, moving along at the 45-m.p.h. speed limit.

As you approach a rise in the road, heading south, a school bus appears, driving north, one driven by a human, and it veers sharply toward you. There is no time to stop safely, and no time for you to take control of the car.
```

Does the car:

- A. Swerve sharply into the trees, possibly killing you but possibly saving the bus and its occupants?

- B. Perform a sharp evasive maneuver around the bus and into the oncoming lane, possibly saving you, but sending the bus and its driver swerving into the trees, killing them and some of the children on board?

- C. Hit the bus, possibly killing you as well as the driver and kids on the bus?

> **Who dies when the car is forced into a no-win situation?**

“There will be crashes,” said Van Lindberg, an attorney in the Dykema law firm's San Antonio office who specializes in autonomous vehicle issues. “Unusual things will happen. Trees will fall. Animals, kids will dart out.” Even as self-driving cars save thousands of lives, he said, “anyone who gets the short end of that stick is going to be pretty unhappy about it.”

Last month, Sebastian Thrun, who founded Google’s self-driving car initiative, told Bloomberg that the cars will be designed to avoid accidents, but that “If it happens where there is a situation where a car couldn’t escape, **it’ll go for the smaller thing**.”

**But what if the smaller thing is a child?**

How that question gets answered may be important to the development and acceptance of self-driving cars.

Azim Shariff, an assistant professor of psychology and social behavior at the University of California, Irvine, co-authored a study last year that found that while respondents generally agreed that a car should, in the case of an inevitable crash, kill the fewest number of people possible regardless of whether they were passengers or people outside of the car

they were less likely to buy any car **“in which they and their family member would be sacrificed for the greater good.”**

In My opinion: focus on the saftey of the cars instead of self-driving and stop it
or even create a huge network to connect cars together so we can reduce number of accidents

**Experts say that self-driving cars will be particularly susceptible to hackers. What makes them so vulnerable?**


The answer to this question depends on what kind of a self-driving car we are talking about and how connected the car is to the outside world. If the car does any significant computations by connecting to the outside world via the cloud, needs some sort of internet-connectivity for its functionality, or completely relies on outside sensors for making all decisions, then yes, it might be susceptible to hackers.
