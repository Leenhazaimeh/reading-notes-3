# Functional Programing..

- Functional programming is a programming model — think of it as a style of building the structure and elements of computer program in way that's divided into small programs

## Pure functions

- If we want to understand functional programming we need to know the first concept of it, and this concept is pure function

## Pure functions

So what is the meaning of pure function ?!

- We know if the function is considered pure or not:

1. If the function returns the same result if given the same arguments (it is also referred as deterministic)
2. If does not cause any observable side effects.
3. Returns same result if given the same arguments.
4. Produces no side effects


## Immutability

- When data is immutable, its state cannot change after it’s created. Instead, you have to create a new object with new values.

## Refactoring JavaScript :

- We usually do Refactoring for JavaScript to make our code more:
1. Readable and and short and easy to understand by outher devoloper so we can do that by using function that help us to make use it mutipule times and help us to make the code better. (Readability)  
2. Readability

## Scenarios:

- URL-shortening website
- social media website
- Return early from functions
- Cache variables so functions can be read like sentences
- Check for Web APIs before implementing
