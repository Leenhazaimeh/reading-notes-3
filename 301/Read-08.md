# SQL
## SQL definetion :

- it's a query language designed to allow both technical and non-technical users query manily for managing data, And SQL DataBase is a place that we have millions of data on it. Also we have many SQL DataBase types.
- selecting data from tables is the most important part as it shows data as table and columns , each row of its own entity and columns share the same properties for that entity.

**Filtering and sorting Query results**

- SQL provides a convenient way to discard rows that have a duplicate column value by using the DISTINCT keyword.

- DISTINCT keyword will blindly remove duplicate rows, ther's another method to discard duplicates based on specific columns using grouping and the GROUP BY clause.
