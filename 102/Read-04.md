# programming with javascript

### A quick over view how computers work 

Computers are unlinke humans, I think humans are smarter but.. computers are more presice and the probability of computers making mistake might be a limit goes to zero while we may make a lot of mistakes as we may get distracted,confused and we also have feelings that might affect our logic. 

Computers are so logical and obedient, you just want to tell them what to do and they will do it exactly as you want, they work by instructions(programs). First of all, I think you have to know what you want the computer to for you then you can break this process into well-organized steps. Flowcharts and diagrams may help yoo doing this. Finally you have to convert these steps into syntax that computers understand which is in our case Javascript. Sometimes computers have to get some engines in order to convert a language syntax to a low-level langugae that the latter will then convert it into machine language which is binary. 

This is a quick brief on how we should interact with computers, so just be logical, precise,pay attention to details and get to know its language to communicate with it effectively!. 

### About Javascript

Javascript is a scripting language that mostly used in web to interact with web pages and web applications. Through Javascript we can turn static web site into a dynamic and interactive experience so we can make slides, animations,applications and alot of other things. it mostly used for front-end and it works for back-end as well. 

Another classifications of this language are procedural programming language which means it executes code line by line also something called OOP with basically treats anything in physical life as objects that have properites,methods and events.


### Javascript syntax

As we said before, javascript used mainly in web world. so it's used alot for interacting with content that it is HTML elements. using java script we can access some content in a web page,modify it, delete it or extracting something from it.

There are many ways for writing script: 

1. External scripts (in another files linked to HTML pages)
2. inside HTML Body (usually after the body tag or after content in body tag works also )
3. Inside HTML Head (used with some keywords to let scripts executed asyncronously for example )

```
<script>

    your script code goes here

<script>
``
