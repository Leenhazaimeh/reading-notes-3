## Operators and comparison 

Operator is a tool that helps you doing some processes, there are three types of operators: 
1. Arithmitic operators like + ,- , /, * , % , ** 
2. Logical operators like && , || , ! 
3. Comparison operators ==, === , != , !===, >= , < and many more. 


### logical operators 

&& stands for "and", the condition cannot be satisfied untill all expression have the same boolean value. 
|| stands for "or" , one expression is enough to satisfy the condition. 
! stands for "not", reverse the boolean value of the expression to the opposite. 


## Loops 

loops are very powerful tools that help you doing many things rather that typing them as many times as they are. They simply keep repeating untill the condition turns to false. 

Examples: 

- While: Usually used when you don't know how many times you will go over the loop. 

- For: When you know how many times you wanna repeat a process. 
- Do - while: do the purpose of using While but apply the process for only once either if the condition is false or true then it checks the while (execute at least one time).
