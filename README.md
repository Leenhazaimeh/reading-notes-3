### Growth Mindset:  
to be in growth mindset means that you are *mature* enough to look at life,work from another perspective which is the big whole picture. congrats! you have reached a level that you could achieve anything you want!, also when you get used to this mindset eveything seems to work easily than ever because your mind is now comfortable with this way of thinking. if you have this mindset, you would likely believe that **hard work** pays off and you will get what you are looking for even if it seems frustrationg right now, also you will be a positive thinker beacuse it's a cycle that will affect your behavior and results! I think there's no such an awesome trait to have in this file 
like this mindset, because if you do it well, it will change your to whatever you want forever and the last important thing that you'll always be feeling satisfied and confident about yourself.

Although you already have this mindset, or just decide to have it; there will be few times you'll feel discouraged and that doesn't work.when you feel this just remeber: 
1. this feeling is completely find, we are humans eventually and your emotions might flip. this is the first step I think and it's really really important to not judge yourself just accept it. *PS:try to control your feelings every time you feel this way even if it doesn't work just to remind your mind that I'm the leader of my emotions and not vice versa!* and in a long-term you'll see that your consious mind behaves as you want. 
2. Take a break! , always award yourself when you feel you did a lot of work so far.also, rest when you are tired. tired not lazy!, a big difference. 
3. Remember that you have a most important tool that is already embeded in your mind by nature which is consciousness and awareness taht will help you catch yourself when you are hoping for instant grafitication and putting excused and recognise that ther are not valid it's just the comfort zone that still try to pull you.
