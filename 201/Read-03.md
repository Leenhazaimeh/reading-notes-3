## Lists 

There are many ways in HTML that lets you insert lists in your content, unordered lists (ul),ordered lists(ol) & definition lists(dl,dt,dd). 

## Boxes

HTML basically deals with elements as they are in boxes and then lets you control width, height, border, padding,margin,display, visibilty, overflow and radius of these boxing using mentioned above CSS properties. 

## basic javascript instructions

the script is some lines of instructions you tell the computer to execute.

Each meaningful line of code in javascript (instruction or step) can be called statement and each statement should be ended with semicolon(;) for a cleaner code purposes. Statement can be included in block codes usually between curly brackets.

Note: Javascript is case sensitive.

a variable is as a container for a data, and data type can be number, string, boolean.

you usually declaring variable by using var prefix , you can aslo use let & const. then assign a value for than variable using (=) and tis line of code called expression. There are also many rules you should follow when you name a varibale.  

regarding data types : for numbers you can use arithmetic operators in declaring variable and assigning them to values, for string you should include them between quotation marks, and boolean should be true or false. 

Arrays : works as a container for many variables, so rathen than declaring many variables with many data types you can include them in one array and recalling their values by their index, and it's 0 based index.

Operator is a tool that helps you doing some processes and calculate values, there are three types of operators:

  

1. Arithmitic operators like + ,- , /, * , % , **

2. Logical operators like and(&&) , or , not(!)

3. Comparison operators ==, === , != , !===, >= , < and many more.

## Desicions and loops

Switch statement is another way of writing conditional statements by simply call a switch with an argument as : switch (level) , then inside curly brackets you start mentioning the cases you expect to have and what to do if that happens liek : Case 'One': // code block then break; , in the last you will include default case which will happen if none of the cases above trigger.

in programming generaly and jvascript , there are values called falsey and the others called truthy. examples of values that are falsey : false,0, '',NaN, empty values(null), undefined variables (undefined). and all others treated as truthy values.  

javascript executes some operations behind the scene like type coercion and because of this feature, it is said to be weak typing language rather than others strict typing languages which requires you to specify the type of the variable. you can check this feature in JS by playing around with the strict and loose equality operators.

loops are very powerful tools that help you doing many things rather that typing them as many times as they are. They simply keep repeating untill the condition turns to false. 

Examples: 

- While: Usually used when you don't know how many times you will go over the loop. 

- For: When you know how many times you wanna repeat a process. 
- Do - while: do the purpose of using While but apply the process for only once either if the condition is false or true then it checks the while (execute at least one time).
