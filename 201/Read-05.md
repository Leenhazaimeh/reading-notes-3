## Images

The <img> element is used to add images to a web page along with specifying a src attribute to indicate the source of an image and an alt attribute to describe the content of an image., you can put them before paragraphs (p) or inside the beginning of a paragraph or between text, then you can control their dimentions using width & height, for alignment using align. 

we should save images at the size you will be using them on the web page and in the appropriate format. you can edit your photos with proper size and resloution using online tools or software as photoshop. if you have a large distribution of same colors you might prefer to use PNG and GIF.
Photographs are best saved as JPEGs; illustrations or logos that use flat colors are better saved as GIFs even though there is SVG format which lets you control the dimension of your photo without affecting the resolution but it still not widespread. 

## Colors 
We don't doubt that colors add life to everything, your web page should also have colors. 

Many ways of declaring colors by:
1. name 
2. rgb or rgba which is with opacity (can take values up to 255 , 0-1 for a)
3. HEX #00ffee where each two sequent numbers stands for rgb. 
4. HSLA which is hue,saturation,brightness and opacity (0-360,percentage,percentage,0-1) 

Note: It is important to ensure that there is enough contrast between any text and the background color (otherwise people will not be able to read your content).

## Text

1. There are many CSS properties to control the choice of font, size, weight, style, and spacing, align.indentation. such as 

    - font-family
    - font-size
    - font-weight
    - line-height
    - font-style 
    - text transform 
    - text-decoration 
    - text-indent
    - text-align
    - vertical align

   Also using pseudo-classes to change the style of an element when a user hovers over or clicks on text, or some edits for links such as : visited,hover,active,focus


2. There is a limited choice of fonts that you can assume most people will have installed. & If you want to use a wider range of typefaces there are several options, but you need to have the right license
to use them.

Note: there are various units for measuring size of a font, fixes such as px & relative like percentage, em & rem.
