# Structure Web pages with HTML

  

## Process & Design

  

When you are intending to build a website, there may be some non so technical process you will likely to follow in order to get your message in hands of your target audience and achieve a nice flow of your website. the first step is to imagine a sample of your target audience with all information you need like demographics, interests and behaviors. After that you have to specifiy the reason they are going to use your website and provide straightforward, clear and useful information to achieve an inspiring experience.

  

Once you do that, you will likely to do sth called site mapping that explains how overall structure of your web pages will look like usually in a heirachy method, then do a wireframe for every page in that heirachy which is a simple sketch for every page in order to let you imagine the final result and facilitate your writing code process.

  
  

## Structure

  

perhaps none of us didn't use Word docs processor before, remember that structure you were doing such as Heading 1 , heading 2 , paragraphs? your web page should be sth similar. Well-structured page will pay attention to headings, the most important heading should be the biggest (heading 1) and the sub-headings go inside with lower heading numbers heading 2 & 3,paragraph lay between them with their proper size and so on which is a commen sense design that will make your content easier to sink anyone's mind.

  

## HTML5 Layout

  

There might be some specifications or we can call *common use* for structuring web pages in HTML. they differ a little from each version of HTML, for example older versions of HTML used to use id attributes in header,footer,content.However, HTML5 which is the recent one help us alot doing this by just calling them as tags `<header>` , `<footer>` and so on ..

  

This example illustrates how HTML5 structures web pages.

``  
	<header>

	<h1>This is a heading 1</h1>

	<nav>

	<ul>

	<li><a href="" class="current">home</a></li>

	<li><a href="">classes</a></li>

	<li><a href="">catering</a></li>

	<li><a href="">about</a></li>

	<li><a href="">contact</a></li>

	</ul>

	</nav>

	</header>
